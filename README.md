# js-musings

My personal Javascript study room. 

## Purpose

I learn better by doing. So most of the times, when I read an interesting article, brush up on some topic or just plain old read a book, I fire up a codepen and start playing around with what I'm studying. It came to my attention, that I wasn't keeping track of those playpens. This is my first attempt at documenting what I learn.
